# disc-tui
A tui for controlling a discord bot written using rust

Frameworks used include [serenity-rs](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) and [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs)

This bot is very similar in functionality to [Hypotenuse Leg](https://github.com/AngleSideAngle/Hypotenuse-Leg), however it runs in the terminal

It has 4 commands: `guilds`, `channels <guild_id>`, `open <channel_id>`, and `help`
Usage example:
```bash
$ disc open 1234
```
